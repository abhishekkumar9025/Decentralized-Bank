# Decentralized Bank

## Project Description
Decentralized Bank is a smart contract-based Ethereum application that allows users to securely deposit and withdraw Ether, while earning interest on their deposits. All operations are handled via trustless blockchain interactions without the need for intermediaries.

## Project Vision
To create a transparent, open-source banking protocol where users remain in full control of their funds and earn interest without relying on centralized financial institutions.

## Key Features
- 📥 **Deposit Functionality**: Users can deposit Ether into the bank at any time.
- 💸 **Withdrawal with Interest**: Users can withdraw their funds along with earned interest.
- 🔒 **Secure & Trustless**: All transactions are handled on-chain with no central authority.
- ⏱️ **Time-Based Interest**: Interest is calculated based on how long the deposit was held.

## Future Scope
- ✅ Integration with front-end UI using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- ✅ Variable interest rates based on market conditions or staking durations.
- ✅ Support for multiple tokens (ERC-20).
- ✅ Role-based access control for advanced banking operations.
- ✅ On-chain governance and community voting for managing interest rates or upgrades.
